# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized
Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
1. RStudio
2. Jupyter
3. SQL
4. JavaScript
Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
1. TensorFlow
2. NumPy
3. SciPy
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib
6. SciKit-Learn
Data Science Tools
| Open Source Tools | Function |
| -------------| ------ |
| Jupyter Notebooks | Unify documentation, code, output from the code, shell commands, and visualizations in a single document |
| RStudio | Tightly integrated into the Jupyter tool and provides optimal user experience. RStudio unifies programming, execution, debugging, remote data access, data exploration, and visualization into one tool |
| Apache Spark | Offering the unique feature of working with distributed datasets, data-frames, and Apache-specific algorithms, this tool is useful to data scientists who are interested in machine learning and text mining. |
### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Jupyter
# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
a = 7
b = 6
c = 4
(a*c)+b
# This will convert 351 minutes to hours by diving by 60
total_minutes = 351
hours = total_minutes / 60
time = "{}".format(hours)
print(time)
Objective:
From this practice, I've learned how to run Jupyter Notebook such as:
* User Markdown
* Use Code
* Create a Table
* Calculate simple arithmetic
